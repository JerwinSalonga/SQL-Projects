## Dataset Details

This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing tech layoff data from March 11, 2020, when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, to March 6, 2023. The data reflects the impact of the global economic slowdown on tech firms, driven by factors such as slow consumer spending, higher interest rates by central banks, and a strong dollar. As these economic conditions hint at a potential recession, many tech companies have started laying off employees. The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022/data).

## Project Overview

I first cleaned the dataset using standard data cleaning techniques to ensure accuracy and consistency. Afterward, I performed an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify which companies or tech sectors were most affected by the pandemic. The analysis focused on uncovering trends and patterns in layoffs, providing insights into how different industries responded to the economic challenges caused by COVID-19.
